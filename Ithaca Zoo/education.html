        As our society continues to face more and more environmental concerns, it is important to foster awareness in children. Itâ€™s never too early to introduce any child to learn and love animals and their natural habitats. Through stories, activities, projects, and more, we hope to encourage more children to become interested in the environment and the animals we share it with. Before exploring the zoo on our own, make sure to stop by the visiting center to pick up a free copy of our map as well as one of our activity books or companion guide book.

        Additionally, sign-up at the visiting center to join a guided tour led by one of our many expert caretakers. Although these additional resources are free, we ask, if able, for a small contribution as you pick up utilize these resources. All proceeds will be used toward our many programs such as the endangered species breeding program as well as to support the Youth Globe Initiative, a non-profit aiming to promote conservation and to fight climate change.

        We understand that it is difficult to travel with young children. When you or your kids need a break, stop by our Kids Forest. Air conditioned in the summer and heated in the winter, we have an indoor seating area with books, puzzles, and some toys your children can enjoy while cooling down or warming up.
